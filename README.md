Shift-Escape
============

This is a Javascript game implemented using Three.js

Control the robot using the W,A,S, and D keys, and move the cursor with the arrow keys.
To shift, hold shift and move the arrow keys in the direction you want to shift. For 
example, holding SHIFT+UP will move a highlighted row up, and holding SHFIT+LEFT will 
move the highlighted row to the left. 

/*** NOTES ****\
I have attempted implement the core mechanic of shifting rows and columns of the game board, 
but I am still encountering bugs. The robot movement has also encountered a bug where the 
robot can only move down, and then the robot may not move again. The movement of the cursor
is fully functional.
